# Airbnb_DataAnalysis
This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations  and location-based trends. 
# Overview
This project involves the analysis and visualization of an Airbnb dataset using Python, Streamlit, and Tableau. The primary goal is to investigate how the price of listings varies across different locations and property types, and to create an interactive dashboard to present key insights.

# The main Python script (airapp.py) performs the following tasks:
Loads and preprocesses the Airbnb dataset.
Creates interactive visualizations using Plotly and Streamlit.
Allows users to filter and explore the data based on various criteria.
Tableau Dashboard
The Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the Airbnb dataset, combining different visualizations to present insights into prices, ratings, and other key metrics.
3 sections :
1. Geo_Visualization of each listing
2. boxPlot for PRice vs PRoperty_Type
3. Map for Location Based insights

# Requirements
Python 3.6+
Streamlit
Pandas
Plotly
Tableau Deskto
Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. You can use the following commands:pip install streamlit pandas plotly
Place the Airbnb dataset (airbnb.json) in the same directory as your Python script.
run the code and done.
